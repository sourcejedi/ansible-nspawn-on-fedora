This repo uses git submodules, to track the roles from Ansible Galaxy.

If you don't know what that means - a simple `git clone` will not include the roles from Ansible Galaxy.
If you want to include them, please read the [submodules chapter](https://alx.github.io/gitbook/5_submodules.html),
especially the pitfalls section.
I suggest also familiarizing yourself with using the reflog, to recover dangling commits.
